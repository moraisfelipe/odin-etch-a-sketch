# odin-etch-a-sketch
This is my first JavaScript project. The motivation is to develop my skills in node.js and the DOM. I recently started  the "Foundations" course in The Odin Project, being 1 of 3 projects in JS that the course propose to us. 

For this project Iâ€™ll (re-)create a web page from a design provided previously by The Odin Project.

I this project I'll build a browser version of an Etch-A-Sketch toy.
